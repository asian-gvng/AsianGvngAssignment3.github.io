			<h3>Topic</h3>

			<p align = "center">The purpose of this project is to develop a fully functional and marketable Water Saving Tool for family households.</br>
			We aim to deliver this final product by the end of 16 weeks of development.
			</p>

			<h3>Motivations</h3>
			<p align= "center">As a team we are motivated to deliver this product due to how excess use of water in Australia has shown how great its importance is in everyone’s livelihood. We plan to help the public with this product, to help automate the simple things as well as allow people to be mindful of their water use. </p>

			<h3>Landscape</h3>
			<p align= "center">Similar systems or products that are available </br>
			Competitors </br>
			Points of difference between our project and what currently exists </br> </br>

			<b>Things that currently exist of similar nature:</b> Water management tools across places such as resorts, hotels, etc that show the user information (digital interface that the user can interact with) about their water usage. Allow owners of said businesses to view and manage the flow of water to different areas of their resort. </br> </br>

			<b>Competitors:</b> Said competitors business model would mostly be related to the distribution of products to large demographics.</br>
			Generally our competitors would sell services rather than products due to the cost and size of their business model.</br>
			Maintenance of these commercial services are incredible costly. For example, tropical resorts will have not only have to deliver clean water everyday into their utilities, their pools, bathrooms and general cleaning use, they’d also have to monitor said water usage, and these Water Saving Services provided by the third-party companies require electricity all year round.
