				<b>Electronics Engineer</b></br></br>
				<b>Electronics Software Programming:</b> Arduino requires to be connected to a computer and programmed with the Arduino IDE. The Arduino programming language consists of the C++ language intertwined with the C language.
				They will program the Arduino following the Object-oriented programming paradigm, matching data to real world objects with attributes.</br>
				<b>Physics and Chemistry:</b> Senior High School to undergraduate University knowledge of Physics and Chemistry is needed to understand and develop electronics with. This is non-compulsory as a requirement, but can help tremendously in developing a commercial product.</br></br>

				<b>Designer</b></br></br>
				<b>Visual Communication Design:</b> VCD is crucial in being able to translate the technicalities for the user. Teaching them how to interact with the product and as well as to how the product works at-first-glance.</br>
				Following modern design conventions, the design must appeal in its appearance and must have shapes and colours which are cohesive.</br>
				<b>Graphic Design:</b> Design in general is enough to fill the requirement. Graphic Design is a highly taught and employed skill when designing user interfaces. The Designer must be knowledgeable and adept in utilising the Adobe suite, mainly Photoshop and Illustrator.</br></br>

				<b>Programmer</b></br></br>
				<b>Programming:</b> Our programmer should have good knowledge of how the C++ and C syntax complement each other. C++ is a programming language derived from ANSI C language but both have their strengths and weaknesses. Understanding how to utilise both languages is crucial in the development of this product.</br>
				<b>Good Communication Skills:</b> Our programmer must work with our Electronics Engineer to develop the overall design of both the software and electronics circuitry designed by the Electronics Engineer of the product.</br>
				During the development of the project, the Programmer must adhere to the ‘Waterfall’ methodology which is a common methodology used in Software Development, therefore must communicate well with the Project Manager, as the Project Manager acts as a medium between the team and the stakeholders.</br></br>

				<b>Project Manager</b></br></br>
				<b>Communication Skills:</b> Communication between the stakeholders and the development team are important. Implementing features within the scope of what the stakeholders want as well as balancing the realistic expectations and abilities of your development team must be communicated between the two.</br>
				<b>Planning:</b> Planning is the most important skill. It keeps deadlines at bay. Even when planning seems unnecessary, thorough planning still proves useful in the long run.</br>
				The Project Manager must be knowledgeable about methodologies employed in the industry. A Methodology, such as the ‘Waterfall’ method, are vital for a healthy and well paced development of a product.</br>
				<b>Problem Solving:</b> During development, human-errors and scope-creeps do happen. Problem Solving alongside planning enables efficiency and effectiveness.</br>
				<b>Detail-oriented:</b> Doing things along-the-way or halfway are problematic in project management. Being detail-oriented prevents scope-creeps and assures efficiency and effectiveness.</br>
				The project manager must be thorough and concise with their planning. Given that the project requires us to develop a fully functional product within 16 weeks, planning is the most crucial skill in project management. The quality assurance, technicalities and functionalities of the product must be completed within the expected timeframe.</br></br>
