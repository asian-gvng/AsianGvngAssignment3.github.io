				<b>Affordable:</b> The project must be affordable for various household sizes. Therefore the quality of the product matches the cost. Physical Programmable Boards are easily obtainable and affordable for mass production, as more and more components are manufactured by competing manufacturers. </br></br>

				<b>Low Maintenance:</b> The Final Product will be low maintenance, due to its simple automated functions, it will not wear and tear as easily as other competing and complex products. </br></br>

				<b>Simple and Minimal:</b> Other competing Water Saving Tools are huge, have complex functions and require a large interface for its complex functions.</br>
				Our product is as small as a tissue box, and only has one interface: A simple one touch Button.</br>

				Once the product is activated, the timer will count down and the LED indicator will start from an array of green coloured LEDs, to yellow coloured LEDs to indicate that the progress is halfway done, to red coloured LEDs meaning it is reaching critical time.</br>

				The reason as to why we are not implementing a simple digital or analog clock as our indicator for our timer feature, is to allow the user feel comfortable with the product. If we were to use a clock over an LED indicator, it will make the user feel rushed and frustrated with the product.</br>

				These are the core features which distinguish our product from other competing products.</br>
